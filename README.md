# exceptions

Exceptions are used to capture situations where there is something wrong with the data that we're using. Exceptions are for dealing with the unexpected, especially where users are concerned, always expect the unexpected. They should not replace validation entirely, but they are useful

An exception itself is generated using the `throw` keyword, in the code where a problem might occur we use the keywords `try` and `catch` - we can catch several different types of exception. 

Exceptions themselves can be redefined, inheriting from the base `Exception` class. 

The Microsoft docs are, as always, a good place to start for more [information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/).
